This error occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android app and involves the `@react-native-community/masked-view` package. The build process fails, and the error message indicates issues with the `com.facebook.react.uimanager.IllegalViewOperationException` exception.  This exception is usually due to a mismatch or conflict between the native modules used in the app and the version of React Native or Expo.
