The solution focuses on managing package versions and resolving native module conflicts.  This might involve:

1. **Cleaning the Expo cache:** `expo prebuild --clean` 
2. **Updating all packages:** `expo upgrade`
3. **Checking package.json:** Ensure there are no conflicting package versions. You might need to use specific versions of related packages compatible with your Expo SDK version.
4. **Downgrading packages:** If updating doesn't resolve, try temporarily downgrading `@react-native-community/masked-view` or related packages to a previously known working version. 
5. **Ejecting from Expo (last resort):** If all else fails, consider ejecting from Expo to have more control over native modules. However, this will mean losing the benefits of Expo's managed workflow.
